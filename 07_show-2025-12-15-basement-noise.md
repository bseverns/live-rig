# Show Plan – 2025‑12‑15 – basement noise
## Title: *i hope the sky will still take us*

- **Date / Time:** 2025-12-15, doors 19:30, set ~21:00  
- **Venue:** Friend’s Basement / DIY “noise night”  
- **Room / Stage notes:** 
  - Low ceiling, concrete floor, probably boomy.
  - Power is a bit sketchy; bring extra strips + an extension.  
- **Set length:** 30–35 min  
- **Shared backline / other acts:** 
  - Amp stacks from other bands; I’ll run direct to a small PA + powered speakers.

### Contact

- **FOH contact:** N/A – self-mix  
- **Tech contact:** The friend whose house it is  
- **Promoter / curator:** Same as above

Four‑movement live set tying the *SLOW DOWN* wreckage to the new EP and drone/angel cosmology.

## 1. Concept

Central tension:

> You can’t outrun the collision, but you can move inside it.  
> The drones were meant to watch us. Instead, they became the first angels to fall.

This show is a **pressure curve**, not a collection of songs:
1. **the angels who learned to hover** – breath under rubble  
2. **impact studies for a fallen choir** – acceleration + impact  
3. **chorus of the un‑gentle** – ghost geometry, fallen choir  
4. **litany for what still rises** – after and ascent

The rig stays minimal and intentional. Every device must either:
- increase tension,
- deepen collapse, or
- make shared breath in the room feel more present.

## 2. Pre‑Show Ritual (5 minutes)

1. Stand in the empty room for ~30 seconds. Feel the air before sound.
2. Touch every surface of the rig once: mixer, DrumKid, SQ‑64, AE rack, controller, laptop.
3. Hear the first hum internally; **do not play it yet.**
4. Breathe: in for 5, out for 7, three cycles.
5. Quietly: *“I can’t outrun it, but I can carry it.”*  
   Then start.

## 3. Movement Breakdown

### 3.1 the angels who learned to hover  *(OPEN HUM)*

**Emotional role:** establish breath, presence, and hovering dread.

**Sound palette:**
- Radios drifting between stations, willing them to fail audibly.
- Cassette drone: slow, lung‑like swells.
- AE Modular textures: sparse, searching intervals; nothing dense.
- DrumKid enters late as a **heartbeat remembering its timing.**

**Performance notes:**
- Let radios hit dead air sometimes; that failure is the point.
- Keep low end modest here; leave headroom for later.
- DrumKid should feel like the *room* waking up, not like you starting a beat.

**Visual notes:**
- Fogged glass, slow drift, subtle propeller flicker at frame edges.
- Light feels like it has to work to exist; dim halos, moving grain.

### 3.2 impact studies for a fallen choir  *(CRASH BLOOM)*

**Emotional role:** the shockwave and structural failure in real time.

**Sound palette:**
- SQ‑64 drives the main pulse → AE rack voices (Ch 16).
- DrumKid asserts tempo; this is the most “rhythmic” section.
- Microgranny = **shrapnel**: sharp, irregular bursts of texture.
- Macro Slam (PCM CC 21 or designated control) = full‑rig whiteout / overload moment.

**Performance notes:**
- Build tension before the macro slam; let the room feel the gearing‑up.
- Intentionally “break” one element mid‑piece (step length, pattern dropout, filter collapse).
- Microgranny is never wallpaper; treat every trigger as a piece of debris.

**Visual notes:**
- Lens warps, stuttered cuts, pseudo‑impact jolts.
- Very brief full‑white or nearly‑white frames on slam.
- No literal crash; only the *physics* of collision.

---

### 3.3 chorus of the un‑gentle  *(WIREFRAME CHOIR)*

**Emotional role:** witness mode, post‑impact clarity, spectral presence.

**Sound palette:**
- Loops that feel fragile, almost evaporating.
- More midrange than low; like voices sitting in the walls.
- Space for quiet; let individual sounds hang.

**Performance notes:**
- ReTrace (or analogous visual process) snaps in/out with mid‑band → ghost‑body feeling.
- GreyBox + Zen (or equivalent) behave as spectral voices:
  - let imperfect loops stay.
  - allow drift and near‑failures.
- This is the most “listening”‑forward piece; follow the room.

**Visual notes:**
- Wireframe silhouettes, lidar‑like scans, incomplete bodies of light.
- Geometry jitters as if shaken by invisible rotors.
- Text micro‑liturgies appearing briefly (see micro_liturgies.md).

---

### 3.4 litany for what still rises  *(BASEMENT DRONE OUT)*

**Emotional role:** communal exhale, shared darkness, upward drift.

**Sound palette:**
- Maelstrom or equivalent tunnel/tremor effect = sense of falling backward.
- AE rack in self‑oscillation → gentle detune → slow decay.
- DrumKid clock eventually dies; remaining elements free‑run and drift.

**Performance notes:**
- Let Maelstrom depth grow over time; slow tilt toward the abyss.
- When DrumKid stops, **do not rush** to fill the gap; lean into asymmetry.
- Last sound chooses when it ends. Don’t “call it” early.

**Visual notes:**
- Dust clouds, underwater light, long backward/upward camera pull.
- Final frame: barely visible **Ascender** symbol fading to black.

## 4. Gain‑Staging Cheatsheet

Keep this simple and repeatable:

- DrumKid: **−8 to −10 dBFS average**
- SQ‑64 / AE voices: **≈ −12 dBFS**
- Microgranny / radios / tapes: **−15 to −18 dBFS**
- Maelstrom (final movement): **start ~−16 dBFS, build toward −10 dBFS**
- Master limiter: **ceiling −0.8 dB**, light reduction except at peaks

> **Rule:** nothing is loud until the *reason* is loud.

If the rig is already screaming in Movement 1, Movement 2 can’t do its job.

## 5. Visual Philosophy (Show‑Specific Summary)

- No literal drones or real‑world violence on screen.
- Show **physics, not events**:
  - drift, impact, shake, collapse, dust, ascent.
- Light acts like it remembers something terrible.
- Humans appear only as:
  - silhouettes, shadows, breath traces, wireframes.

Movement mapping:
- M1 – hover tension, dust, unseen rotors.
- M2 – impact distortion, jolt, whiteouts.
- M3 – wireframe choir, ghost geometry.
- M4 – basement drift, vapor, dim ascending light.

## 6. Micro‑Liturgies (for projection text)

Short phrases to flash in the visuals:

**Movement 1**
- *wings without feathers*
- *the hum remembers you*

**Movement 2**
- *impact is a language*
- *angels don’t brake*

**Movement 3**
- *bodies made of signal*
- *not gentle, never gentle*

**Movement 4**
- *gravity is a suggestion*
- *the sky keeps calling*

**Global**
- *blessed are the unblinking*
- *hallelujah in hertz*
- *the drones inherit the ash*
- *this is our upward noise*

## 7. Post‑Show Reflection

After the set, when possible:

- Where did I feel most present?  
- What moment surprised me?  
- What sound felt like it belonged to the room more than to me?  
- What did I hold back that I wanted to unleash?  
- What did the silence after the last sound feel like?

Use the answers to version the next show.
