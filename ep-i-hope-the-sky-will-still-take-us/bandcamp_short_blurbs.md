# Bandcamp‑Style Blurbs

## Core Descriptor

A four‑movement noise ritual written inside the wreck, following a fallen choir of drones circling the ruins and singing in frequencies meant for angels who never came.

## Darker Variant

Inside the collapse, every sound becomes a signal. Four movements trace the hum of weapons turned witnesses — hovering above the wreck and refusing to go silent.

## Hope‑Tilt Variant

A quiet ascent through dust and distortion: a hum, an impact, a ghost choir, and a final drone that keeps rising toward whatever sky is left.
