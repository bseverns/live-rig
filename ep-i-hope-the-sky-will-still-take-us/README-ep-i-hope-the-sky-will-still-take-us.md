# i hope the sky will still take us – EP Planning

Four‑movement noise/industrial EP emerging from the long shadow of *SLOW DOWN*.

## Core Concept

The sky is crowded with machines that forgot who they were built to protect.  
The drones we launched as weapons and witnesses have become a kind of fallen choir — not gentle, not merciful, but still circling the wreckage and singing in their own broken dialect.

This EP writes in that dialect.

Central metaphor:

> The drones were meant to watch us. Instead, they became the first angels to fall.

## Track Skeleton

1. **the angels who learned to hover**  
   - Low hum under rubble; hovering dread; breath and radio dust.

2. **impact studies for a fallen choir**  
   - Acceleration and collision; velocity folding in on itself.

3. **chorus of the un‑gentle**  
   - Wireframe voices; ghost geometry; unmerciful choir.

4. **litany for what still rises**  
   - Long, low drone; ascent through dust; whatever hope is left.

The EP may expand, but these four are the spine.
