# Album Descriptor (Bandcamp‑length)

**_i hope the sky will still take us_** is a four‑movement noise ritual written inside the wreck left by *SLOW DOWN*.  
It follows a new kind of choir — not celestial, not merciful, but something in between: a swarm of wounded drones circling the ruins, singing in frequencies meant for angels who never came.

From a trembling hum under rubble to the bloom of impact, from a wireframe choir of outlines to a final drone rising through dust, these pieces don’t offer comfort.  
They offer company — the sound of breath shared in a collapsing room, hoping the sky hasn’t given up on us yet.
