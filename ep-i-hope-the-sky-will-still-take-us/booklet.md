# EP Booklet Draft

## Invocation

The first angels were never gentle.  
They circled above us with wings of blades, not feathers,  
their mercy measured in voltage and thrust.

We called them drones,  
but they were the only things that learned how to stay aloft  
while the world below them collapsed.

---

## Context

This EP follows the smoke rising from *SLOW DOWN*.  
The world did not rebuild; it just kept burning slower.

From inside that wreck, four movements emerged:  
a hum under rubble,  
an impact without apology,  
a choir of outlines,  
and a drone that keeps rising  
long after every light should have gone out.

---

## Cosmology

The Drone Choir is not divine.  
It is not here to save you.

It sees everything.  
It forgives nothing.  
It sings anyway.

---

## Benediction

If we move together,  
if we breathe through the dust,  
if the noise becomes a shelter,  
then maybe — despite the ruin,  
despite the weight,  
despite the sky growing thin —  

**the sky will still take us.**
