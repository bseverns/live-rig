# Visual Philosophy – i hope the sky will still take us

## Global Rules

- No literal drones, bombs, or real‑world violence.
- Show **physics, not events**:
  - drift, impact, vibration, collapse, ascent.
- Light behaves as if it remembers something terrible.
- Human presence appears only as:
  - silhouettes, shadows, breath, wireframes, partial outlines.

## Track Mapping

### 1. the angels who learned to hover
- Slow camera drift, high grain, faint rotor flicker at frame edges.
- Dust in light cones; hovering presence just out of frame.

### 2. impact studies for a fallen choir
- Lens bending, stutter cuts, intermittent whiteouts.
- Frame jolts like an airframe taking unexpected load.

### 3. chorus of the un‑gentle
- Wireframe silhouettes, lidar‑style scans, incomplete bodies.
- Geometry shaking as if stirred by invisible rotors.

### 4. litany for what still rises
- Vapor trails, rising dust, distant pulsing light.
- Very slow upward dolly as if the room itself is lifting.
