# Track‑Specific Teasers

## 1. the angels who learned to hover
- Wreckage: A breath caught under the rubble — a low hum searching for a horizon that isn’t there anymore.  
- Hope: A flickering pulse that remembers how to rise, even with dust in its lungs.

## 2. impact studies for a fallen choir
- Wreckage: Impact without warning; velocity folding in on itself until the room shudders.  
- Hope: A violent bloom that somehow leaves a narrow path through the debris.

## 3. chorus of the un‑gentle
- Wreckage: Ghost geometry singing from inside the damage — outlines of voices trying to hold their shape.  
- Hope: A fragile choir of lines and light learning to breathe again where bodies once stood.

## 4. litany for what still rises
- Wreckage: A deep, slow collapse into shadow — the hum that lingers after everything else has failed.  
- Hope: A long, low drone drifting toward the faintest opening, carrying whatever remains toward the surface.
