# Live Rig System Diagrams

This bundle collects mermaid diagrams and scratch-note areas for your live performance ecosystem:

- Hardware instruments and mixers
- Pedalboard and FX loops
- Teensy-based DSP boxes (Horizon, DiceLoop, Lo-Fi Sampler)
- Mac laptop, audio interface, and Signal Culture (SC) video apps
- Clock / MIDI / routing layout
- A focused map of the SCApps you own and a few standard “rig” patches
- Additional glue/glitter machines: **frZone** (Freq-Zone triggers) and **LineLight** (listening lamp)

Each `.md` file includes:

- One or more **mermaid diagrams**
- A **Notes** section for venue-specific wiring, connector types, sync details, and open questions

You can view these in any markdown viewer that supports mermaid (GitHub, VS Code with extension, Obsidian, etc.).
